# Muck-VR-Mod
## Installation
It's stupid easy to install, just install bepinex then unzip the realease version of this mod into the muck folder, and you are done installing.
## Plans
Probably not gonna get very far with this as there is no way to implement controller support with the current VR lib, if someone knows more than i with how the legacy unity vr support works to implement motion controls hit me up (my discord is on my github profile) and i'll be sure to work on this again.
